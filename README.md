# Assurances, Audits & Accountability

This repository contains the implementation and demonstration of a typed simplicial complex framework for document verification, validation, and assurance of AI Generated Content with explicit human accountability. 

![Accountability Complex](docs/images/assurance_complex.png)

**INCOSE Paper Assurance Complex:** 23 vertices | 91 edges | 44 faces | χ = -24
21 documents + 1 root + 1 signer | 22 assurances + 22 signatures | Paper has 2 distinct assurance faces

## The Paper

The paper **"Test-Driven Document Development: Simplicial Complexes for Verification, Validation, and Assurance with Human Accountability"** demonstrates a framework where:

- **Documents are vertices** (0-simplices) in a typed complex
- **Verification, validation, and coupling are edges** (1-simplices) connecting documents
- **Assurance triangles are faces** (2-simplices) representing complete quality attestation
- **Human accountability** is structurally required for validation judgments

**The paper is its own proof.** The file [`doc-incose-paper-2026.md`](00_vertices/doc-incose-paper-2026.md) exists as a vertex in an assurance complex, verified against its specification, validated against its guidance, with all checks passing.

## Dual Interface: VS Code + Obsidian

This repository is designed for **two complementary workflows**:

### VS Code + Claude Code (Construction & Verification)

![VS Code Interface](docs/images/vs-code-interface.png)

**Best for:** Building, verifying, and analyzing the knowledge complex

- Run verification scripts directly from terminal
- Edit documents with full IDE features
- Use Claude Code for AI-assisted document development
- Git integration for version control and accountability

**Key commands:**
```bash
python scripts/verify_template_based.py <file> --templates templates
python scripts/audit_assurance_chart.py charts/<chart>/<chart>.md
python scripts/build_cache.py
```

### Obsidian (Navigation & Exploration)

![Obsidian Interface](docs/images/obsidian-interface.png)

**Best for:** Exploring relationships and understanding structure

- Wiki-style `[[wikilinks]]` for seamless navigation
- Graph view visualizes document relationships
- Backlinks show what references each document
- Local-first, works offline

**To use:** Open this repository as an Obsidian vault. See [[QUICKSTART]] for a 5-minute guide.

## Quick Verification

```bash
# Setup
git clone https://github.com/DynamicalSystemsGroup/assurances-audits-accountability
cd assurances-audits-accountability
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt

**Expected output:**

```text
Result: ✓ PASS

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

### The Assurance Triangle

Every assured document requires three edges forming a closed triangle:

1. **Verification edge** → document passes structural checks against spec
2. **Coupling edge** → spec is linked to corresponding guidance
3. **Validation edge** → document assessed against guidance (requires human approver)

### The V - F ≤ 1 Invariant

In a valid assurance complex:

- Every non-root vertex must have at least one assurance face
- Every face assures exactly one vertex
- **V - F = 1** when each document is assured exactly once
- **V - F < 1** when documents have multiple assurances (e.g., dual spec-guidance pairs)
- **V - F ≤ 1** is necessary but not sufficient for validity—useful as a quick spot-check to identify invalid complexes

### The Boundary Condition and Boundary Complex

**Boundary Condition:** The framework bootstraps through four foundational vertices—spec-for-spec (SS), spec-for-guidance (SG), guidance-for-spec (GS), guidance-for-guidance (GG)—mutually assured in a self-referential pattern. Two form valid triangles (SG, GS), while two rely on self-reference (SS via self-verification, GG via self-validation), creating degenerate faces.

**Boundary Complex:** A fifth vertex, *root* (b0), is introduced as an axiomatic element (not a document requiring assurance). The self-loops are rewired to connect through the root, eliminating degeneracy faces and providing a valid simplicial complex foundation. The root provides assurance but doesn't need it—this is what makes V - F = 1 work.

## Runbooks
